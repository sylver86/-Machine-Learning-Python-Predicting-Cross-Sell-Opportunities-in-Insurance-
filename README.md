# Machine Learning Python: Predicting Cross-Sell Opportunities in Insurance

🎯 **Objective:** Crafted a predictive model for a leading insurance company to identify potential customers interested in purchasing vehicle insurance based on their previous health insurance history.

## Key Achievements

🔍 **Data Mastery:**
   - Explored a diverse dataset with unique buyer attributes.
   - Leveraged insights from gender, age, driving license status, region-specific details, and more.

🌟 **Challenging Task Conquered:**
   - Successfully predicted buyer responses to sales proposals.
   - Contributed to optimizing cross-selling strategies for the business.

💡 **Innovative Approaches:**
   - Implemented advanced techniques to handle imbalanced class distribution.
   - Ensured model accuracy and reliability, setting it apart in the field.

## Detailed Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleansed and prepared the dataset by normalizing features and handling missing values, ensuring the data was suitable for analysis.
   - Engineered new features to enrich the dataset, providing deeper insights for the predictive models.

### 2. Customer Clustering:
   - Applied clustering algorithms to segment the customer base into distinct groups based on their attributes. This step helped in understanding diverse customer behaviors and preferences.
   - Utilized techniques like K-means and hierarchical clustering to identify and categorize customer segments effectively.

### 3. Target Variable Definition through Cluster Analysis:
   - Analyzed the resulting clusters to determine patterns and characteristics that define potential buyers of vehicle insurance.
   - Established a target variable for the predictive modeling based on cluster insights, focusing on those most likely to convert.

### 4. Implementation of Machine Learning Models:
   - **4a Naive Bayes Bernoulli:** Tested for binary classification based on features converted into binary format.
   - **4b Naive Bayes Gaussian:** Employed for features with a normal distribution, assessing the likelihood of purchasing based on statistical probabilities.
   - **4c SVC Kernel Linear:** Applied for linearly separable data, maximizing the margin between classes.
   - **4d SVC Kernel Polynomial:** Used to model more complex relationships through higher-dimensional spaces.
   - **4e SVC Kernel Sigmoid:** Explored for its ability to model nonlinear relationships similar to neural network behavior.
   - **4f SVC Kernel Gaussian (RBF):** Best for handling non-linear separation in data through transformation into higher dimensions.
   - **4g Neural Network:** Configured to learn through layers of interconnected nodes, capturing intricate patterns in large data sets.
   - **4h Nearest Neighbors:** Implemented to classify based on the proximity to the nearest data points, useful for small datasets.
